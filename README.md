# Social Network Analysis with R

Social Network Analysis with R demonstrates how to visualize and analyze data from a social network like Twitter or Facebook with the text-based statistical language, R. If you're involved in analytics in any capacity, this repository could be a huge help, showing you how the R **sna** and **igraph** modules works and how to format data for analysis, create graphs, analyze network graphs, and visualize networks. Use the examples in this repository to explore how to examine the relationships and trends among networks in new and exciting ways, and discover information about how individuals in an organization interact.

## Learning objectives:
